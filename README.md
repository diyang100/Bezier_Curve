# Bezier_Curve
A website to simulate properties of bezier curves.

Features creation of up to 20 curves and analysis via
De Casteljau's Algorithm, Bernstein Polynomial Form, and
First Derivative (velocity) of the curve.

Upcoming features include the radius of curvature, bounding box,
and arc length parameterization of the bezier curve.
